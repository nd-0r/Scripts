# Fill YMCA Form

A small script I wrote to learn the selenium web driver Python interface for testing my website. Using data about ymca locations, a ymca member, and preferred times, the script registers for the appointment one week in advance. The times happen to be released exactly one week in advance at the appointment time, so this script just gets my desired time, else a time within half an hour or my desired time, before anyone else does.
